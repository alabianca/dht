# A DHT implementation based on Kademlia

This is the start of an attempt to implement a DHT based on Kademlia written in javaScript (Node.js).
If you like to learn more about Kademlia and its implementation a good place to start is [Kademlia: A Peer-to-peer Information System Based on the XOR metric](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/~petar/papers/maymounkov-kademlia-lncs.pdf) and
[Kademlia: a Design Specification](http://xlattice.sourceforge.net/components/protocol/kademlia/specs.html).
